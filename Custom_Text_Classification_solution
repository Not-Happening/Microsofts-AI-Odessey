Custom text classification adds labels to classes
for example video games can be classified into genres(adventure,puzzle etc)

Custom text classification falls into two types of projects:

** Single label classification **
you can assign only one class to each file. 
Following the above example, a video game summary could only be classified as "Adventure" or "Strategy".

** Multiple label classification ** 
you can assign multiple classes to each file. 
This type of project would allow you to classify a video game summary as "Adventure" or "Adventure and Strategy".

** Labeling data **
->In single label projects, each file is assigned one class during the labeling process; class assignment in Azure AI Language only allows you to select one class.
->When labeling multiple label projects, you can assign as many classes that you want per file

** Evaluating and improving your model **
Kinds of errors when classification isnt correct
->False positive - model predicts x, but the file isn't labeled x.
->False negative - model doesn't predict label x, but the file in fact is labeled x.

These metrics are translated into three measures provided by Azure AI Language:
->Recall - Of all the actual labels, how many were identified; the ratio of true positives to all that was labeled.
->Precision - How many of the predicted labels are correct; the ratio of true positives to all identified positives.
->F1 Score - A function of recall and precision, intended to provide a single score to maximize for a balance of each component.
