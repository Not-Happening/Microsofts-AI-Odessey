Language detection - determining the language in which text is written.

the Azure AI Language Detection API helps figure out the language used in a piece of text. This can be useful for situations where you have text in an unknown language, like in a chatbot where users might speak different languages.

Key points:

->It analyzes text and tells you what language it is.
->The API provides a confidence score, indicating how sure it is about the detected language (a score between 0 and 1).
->It's handy for applications like chatbots, where you want to understand the user's language and respond accordingly.
->The text you analyze should be less than 5,120 characters, and you can't have more than 1,000 pieces of text to analyze at once.
->You can also give a hint about the country to improve accuracy if needed.

If you pass in a document that has multilingual content, the service will behave a bit differently. 
Mixed language content within the same document returns the language with the largest representation in the content and the confidence level will be relatively low.

EXAMPLE:
{
  "documents": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "text": "Hello, I would like to take a class at your University. ¿Se ofrecen clases en español? Es mi primera lengua y más fácil para escribir. Que diriez-vous des cours en français?"
    }
  ]
}

OUTPUT:
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "detectedLanguage": {
                "name": "Spanish",
                "iso6391Name": "es",
                "confidenceScore": 0.9375
            },
            "warnings": []
        }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2022-10-01"
}

 if the language detection system can't understand or read the text you submit because of issues like character encoding problems,
 it won't be able to figure out the language. In such cases, the response will show "(unknown)" for the language and an associated ISO code, 
 and the confidence score will be 0, indicating low confidence due to the difficulty in analyzing the text.

OUTPUT:
{
    "documents": [
        {
            "id": "1",
            "detectedLanguage": {
                "name": "(Unknown)",
                "iso6391Name": "(Unknown)",
                "confidenceScore": 0.0
            },
            "warnings": []
        }
    ],

2- KEY PHRASE EXTRACTION

Key phrase extraction is the process of evaluating the text of a document, or documents, and then identifying the main points around the context of the document(s).
Key phrase extraction works best for larger documents (the maximum size that can be analyzed is 5,120 characters).

{
    "kind": "KeyPhraseExtraction",
    "parameters": {
        "modelVersion": "latest"
    },
    "analysisInput":{
        "documents":[
            {
              "id": "1",
              "language": "en",
              "text": "You must be the change you wish 
                       to see in the world."
            },
            {
              "id": "2",
              "language": "en",
              "text": "The journey of a thousand miles 
                       begins with a single step."
            }
        ]
    }
}

The ressponse will be something like this 
{
    "kind": "KeyPhraseExtractionResults",
    "results": {
    "documents": [   
        {
         "id": "1",
         "keyPhrases": [
           "change",
           "world"
         ],
         "warnings": []
       },
       {
         "id": "2",
         "keyPhrases": [
           "miles",
           "single step",
           "journey"
         ],
         "warnings": []
       }
],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2021-06-01"
    }
}

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS:

Sentiment analysis is used to evaluate how positive or negative a text document is, which can be useful in various workloads, such as:
Evaluating a movie, book, or product by quantifying sentiment based on reviews.
Prioritizing customer service responses to correspondence received through email or social media messaging.

{
  "kind": "SentimentAnalysis",
  "parameters": {
    "modelVersion": "latest"
  },
  "analysisInput": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "language": "en",
        "text": "Good morning!"
      }
    ]
  }
}

OUTPUT:
{
  "kind": "SentimentAnalysisResults",
  "results": {
    "documents": [
      {
        "id": "1",
        "sentiment": "positive",
        "confidenceScores": {
          "positive": 0.89,
          "neutral": 0.1,
          "negative": 0.01
        },
        "sentences": [
          {
            "sentiment": "positive",
            "confidenceScores": {
              "positive": 0.89,
              "neutral": 0.1,
              "negative": 0.01
            },
            "offset": 0,
            "length": 13,
            "text": "Good morning!"
          }
        ],
        "warnings": []
      }
    ],
    "errors": [],
    "modelVersion": "2022-11-01"
  }
}

-> Sentence sentiment is based on confidence scores for positive, negative, and neutral classification values between 0 and 1.
Overall document sentiment is based on sentences:
If all sentences are neutral, the overall sentiment is neutral.
If sentence classifications include only positive and neutral, the overall sentiment is positive.
If the sentence classifications include only negative and neutral, the overall sentiment is negative.
If the sentence classifications include positive and negative, the overall sentiment is mixed.
