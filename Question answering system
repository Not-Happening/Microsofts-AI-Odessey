Azure AI Language offers a feature that allows you to create a database of questions and their corresponding answers.
This database can be used by applications, like chatbots, to provide responses when users ask questions in everyday language. 
The information for this database can come from various sources, such as FAQ pages on websites, structured text files like brochures, or even pre-defined casual conversation examples.
This capability helps in making applications more conversational and responsive to user queries.


QUESTION ANSWERING AND LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING
Use the question answering knowledge base when you have specific questions and want direct answers.
Use the conversational language understanding feature when you want a more natural and interactive chat with your computer.(like a normal coversation)

MULTI TURN CONVERSATIONS:
multi turn converdations are the kind of conversations where we have to question ourselves again to answer the question.
if A asks how to cancel reservation
B must ask a follow up question if it is hotel or plane.
When setting up a system for handling questions and answers, you can make it understand multi-turn conversations in two ways.
For instance, if someone asks, "How can I cancel a reservation?" and the system needs more details,
it can be taught to ask follow-up questions like "Is it about a hotel or a flight?" 
The response can then include information like "Cancellation policies vary based on the type of reservation,"
along with clickable links for details on canceling flights or hotels. 
This helps the system provide relevant information in the context of the ongoing conversation.

TESTING AND PUBLISHING A KNOWLEDGE BASE:
after training a language model with a knowledge base we must test it before publishing it for use
in Azure we can test it interactively with language Studio

After creating and testing a knowledge base we should improve its quality(performance)
Active learning can help you make continuous improvements to get better at answering user questions correctly over time. 
People often ask questions that are phrased differently, but ultimately have the same meaning.
Active learning can help in situations like this because it enables you to consider alternate questions to each question and answer pair. 
Active learning is enabled by default.
